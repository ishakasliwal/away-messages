# awaymessag.es
the old aim away messages ui made with JUST html and css (insert audible 'wows' here). you can edit the label and message of the away message... and screenshot it 4 now i guess if you want to share w your friends.

#### things that i know are missing ok
i plan to make the text customizable using those color, size, etc. buttons, and redo this whole thing using canvas so that it can render as an image and ppl won't have to screenshot it. one step at a time ~~~~
